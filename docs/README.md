## Standup Reports

Daily standup reports are automatically generated by the Antigravity workflow and stored in the `standups/` directory.

Each report includes:
- Work completed (yesterday)
- Work in progress (today)
- Blockers and issues
- CI/CD status
- Team member summaries

## Naming Convention

Standup files follow ISO date format: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Example: `2026-01-09.md` for January 9th, 2026
